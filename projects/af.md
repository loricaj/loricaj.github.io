Animal Farm is a set of labs meant to teach the basics of C and C++ and introduce good Software Engineering practices. Students work on this project throughout the semester as the code changes based on different requirements.

We kept making improvements to the project as we learned more efficient ways of doing things. We began with using arrays for the database, then switched to structures. After that, we added singly and doubly linked lists and finally moved on to binary search trees.

Besides learning technical skills, the project also taught me how to manage my time for a big task. It was the largest project I had worked on at that time. I realized I couldn't finish it all at once, and it required multiple long sessions. This project changed the way I handle significant assignments.
