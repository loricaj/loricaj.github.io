Over the past 5 years of programming I surprisingly haven’t used Javascript much at all. My computer science course in my senior year of high school was taught in Java and all my computer engineering classes were taught in either C or C++. My first taste of Javascript was around a year ago where I took some online courses on Codeacademy over winter break after hearing Javascript was a very important language to know in the software engineering industry. In this course I also learned about HTML and CSS. I didn’t really code a lot in Javascript until this summer where I interned for an IT consulting company and had to program primarily in Javascript. 
Overall, the switch from C and C++ to Javascript wasn’t too difficult as the logic was similar but the only difficult part was the subtle differences in syntax and getting used to not using types when creating variables. Coming from a typed programming language I found it very odd initializing variables without types. I had some struggles thinking about the logic of my code when the variable types aren't blatently obvious sometimes. The common error I kept making the first week of Javascript was creating for loop initializing the counter as int i=0. The more I’ve used Javascript, I begin to see the power this programming language can potentially have. I still don’t have much experience with Javascript but I do think it is definetely an effective and efficient programming language from a software engineering perspective. One benefit over C and C++ that I immidietely noticed is the simplicity when it comes to parsing data.
	Athletic software engineering is a concept completely new to me. So far I’ve found the practice WODs very useful as I am a firm believer in effective practice will make you better. This style of learning allows me to stay consistent with my learning and keep improving gradually over time. The in-class WODs are definitely a little bit stressful but I honestly enjoy it a lot. When it comes to timed exams or quizzes I’m a bit weird in the way I enjoy the stress of taking timed assessments. Although the idea of the in-class WODs being full or no credit is a bit daunting to me, I believe this style of learning will fit me perfectly. So far I'm enjoying learning Javascript and I look forward to becoming more competent in this language.
