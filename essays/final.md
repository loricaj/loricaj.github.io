Software Engineering is a career path I've heard many times throughout my academic career but what do software engineers actually do? Through ICS 314 - Software Engineering, I've been able answer this question.

## Open Source Software Development
Open-source software development involves creating and improving computer programs with freely accessible source code. Unlike closed or proprietary software, open-source allows anyone to view, modify, and share the code. This method encourages developers worldwide to work together, improve features, and solve problems. This allows people from all over the world with different ideas and backgrounds to contribute to the sucess of a project.

## Agile Project Management
Agile project management involves breaking down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks. Although I prefer completing tasks in one go, complex projects require multiple people working together. For out project we created milestones with specific issues to address to make the overall project more achievable. This approach helped maintain my stress levels and balance with other classes. I now see it as a valuable skill for handling future work recognizing that most jobs won't involve tasks that can be done in a single sitting. I'll apply these lessons to break down work into achievable pieces within a given timeframe.

## Fun
This class was one of the more fun and rewarding ones. Being able to write code and having something functional on my screen was definetly the highlight for this class. Although there were many positive moments in this class, there were many struggles as well. Overall, tihs class has taught me so much about software engineering and has sparked excitement in my future.
