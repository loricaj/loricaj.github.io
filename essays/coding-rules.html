  <p>Coding standards might seem minor, but they’re actually very important for writing good code and collaborating effectively. I believe coding standards are crucial and can even help you learn a programming language. I’ll also share my thoughts on using ESLint with IntelliJ after one week of use.
What Are Coding Standards? Coding standards are rules for how code should look and be written. They’re not just about style, they help make code readable and maintainable. Coding standards can be great for learning a programming language. For example, they teach you how to format your code correctly so your code compiles and runs correctly. Tools like ESLint in IntelliJ help enforce coding standards automatically. In my first week I found it very useful to help pinpoint mistakes. There were many times where I simply made a small error such as a typo or a missing semi colon and ESLint was able to catch it very quickly. Another cool feature of ESLint was it’s ability to optimize and clean up code lines and blocks. One example is ESLint notifys you if a variable or function is not being used.</p>

<p>My experience with ESLint was a mixure of both positive and negative. It could be annoying at times, but it improved my code quality overall. An example of a time where I got annoyed is ESLint throwing errors when I didn’t put a space in between the closing bracket of a function parameter and the opening curly brace for the function body. For most of my coding career I usually don’t put a space there but ESLint believe it’s coding standard for that space to be there although the output would be exaxtly the same. Another interesting coding standard I learned from ESLint is the need for a blank line at the end of the code. I’m not sure what the purpose or effect of this empty line is but it is standard.</p>

<p>Coding standards also matter a lot for teamwork. They help team members read and review each other’s code easily. They also keep the code consistent and make it easier to maintain over time. When it comes to larger projects, it is very common and almost necessary to have multiple people working on code. In this situation it is of utmost importance to have some coding standard set. Any deviation of coding style can potentially break other parts of code and will definitely be more difficult to debug.</p>

<p>In conclusion, coding standards are important for good code and teamwork. They can also help you learn a programming language better. While using tools like ESLint may have its challenges, they ultimately make us better software engineers by fostering good coding habits and collaboration.</p>
