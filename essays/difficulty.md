Whether it because of my ego or fear of embarrassment, sometimes I struggle asking for help from my peers or professors. I do trust people who I know to be more knowledgeable than me, but when I approach information provided by less trusted sources, I tread with caution. While this cautious approach has helped me in various situations, it also has its downsides. Over time, I've come to realize the benefit and importance in asking for help when I need. To become the best engineer I can be, I must cultivate the habit of seeking help more frequently and thoroughly considering alternative solutions to my problems. Collaboration is vital for software engineers, as multiple minds working together can lead to quicker and more efficient problem-solving. One convenient way to facilitate this collaboration is through online forums like Stack Overflow, where individuals can pose questions and receive answers from others.
While we often hear that "There are no stupid questions" from our teachers, in the world of software engineering, not all questions align with this sentiment. Sometimes, it's not the question itself that's foolish, but rather how it's asked. There are also cases where the question is straightforward or the answer is readily available, if only the person asking had done some basic research. For example, on a recent Stack Overflow post, someone had a question about a coding language they clearly didn't understand. Their issue could have been resolved with a simple search about the basics of C++. Another user even suggested they should read a good C++ book, implying that their question was quite basic and didn't require external help. These types of questions can be unproductive for everyone involved. The person asking the question might get an answer, but it can falsely boost their confidence when they lack a foundational understanding of the language. If they struggle with one basic aspect, they probably have gaps in their knowledge of other essential aspects. I can say this because I've been in the position of asking such questions before. For the person answering, it can be a waste of time and effort to respond to a question that has already been addressed. I can also speak from experience on this, as I've been on the answering side of similar situations.
How can you ask a "smart question"? It may be a bit more complex than you think, but it's worth it. When you ask smart questions, not only will others understand you better, but the answers you receive will also be better than if you asked a less thoughtful question. Letâ€™s look at an example on Stack Overflow where someone asked a really good question. They started with a clear title that summed up their main question. Then, they provided more details about their problem in the body of the post. They also included their code, not just a picture of it, and explained what happened when they ran it. They even mentioned that they tried the same thing in a different programming language. In the end, they wrapped up their question by summarizing the key points they wanted answers to. Because they asked such a well-structured question, they received a detailed and helpful answer. The person who answered their question explained the concept the poster was confused about and broke down the code. This shows that when you ask good questions, you're more likely to get good answers.
